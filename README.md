# mini-e-commerce-website
Built a simple yet functional mini e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features include product listings, add-to-cart functionality, and a clean UI focused on user experience. This project helped me strengthen my frontend fundamentals and understand real-world web flows. Excited to keep building and learning.
